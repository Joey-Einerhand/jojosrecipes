title: Speculaas Tiramisu Version 1
prep-time: 60min
cook-time: 0min
total-time: 60min
ingredients: |
  ###### For the mascarpone filling:
  1. 500 grams Mascarpone
  2. 100 grams sugar
  3. 1/4th (1g) teaspoon salt
  4. 2 medium eggs (110g weighed with shells)
  5. Some hot coco mix for the top
  <br /><br />

  ###### For the bottom layer:
  1. 250 milliliters coffee (No sugar/milk added) 
  2. 20 grams of hot coco mix
  3. around 410 grams Speculaas/Pepernoten (Spiced Bisquit)


steps: |
  This recipe fills a 35cmx20cmx5cm pan.
  ##### Bottom layer:
  1. Mix the 250ml coffee with the 20g hot coco mix
  2. In a large bowl, combine the coffee-coco mix with the Speculaas
  3. Mix the speculaas and coffee-coco mix until the speculaas becomes a smooth paste. Bits and pieces of speculaas is OK
  4. Fill the pan with the speculaas paste and smoothen it with a spoon.

  #### Top layer:
  1. Crack the eggs in a bowl. Add the sugar and salt
  2. [Bain Marie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dfj-ucrtI0A) the egg mixture to around 74 degrees Celcius to pasturise the eggs; this kills bacteria and makes it safer to eat than raw eggs. For this step, an instant-read thermometer is recommended
  3. Transfer the Bain Marie'd egg mixture into a bowl and whip them up until they form [soft peaks](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-beat-egg-whites-baking-meringues-chiffon-cakes-souffles-slideshow). You can do this by hand (not recommended). I use a hand mixer or a stand mixer.
  4. When stiff peaks have formed, add the mascarpone one thick tablespoon at a time and mix. The mixture does not need to be smooth, small parts of mascarpone is OK.
  5. When all mascarpone is incorporated, spread the mixture over the Speculaas bottom
  6. Flatten the mascarpone mixture with a spoon
  7. Using a sieve, create a top layer of hot coco powder over the mascarpone layer
  <br /><br />

  And you're done! I recommend setting it aside (1 or 2 hours) so the hot coco top layer absorbs some of the mascarpone liquid, but it can also be eaten straight away!

I developed this recipe myself, and I'm still experimenting with it. When in season, I try to make this Tiramisu with Pepernoten, but any speculaas ("Spiced Bisquit") will do.

This recipe will fill for a 35cmx20cmx5cm pan.

My speculaas tiramisu is a two-layered twist on the classic italian tiramisu recipe. If you're looking for a classic tiramisu recipe, I can wholeheartedly recommend [Stella Parks' "Rich and Creamy Tiramisu" on Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-tiramisu-recipe) 

This tiramisu has two layers: The speculaas bottom, and the creamy mascarpone top. 
I cannot recommend stacking multiple layers, since Speculaas is too heavy to create multiple layers with.

I personally do not like the alcohol flavour in my Tiramisu, so I omitted it from this recipe.

Whilst I love Tiramisu with lady fingers, I find the rich taste of speculaas to really add to the overall taste of the tiramisu dish.

Whilst not needed, these are the exact brands I used for this recipe:
Galbani Mascarpone, 17g perla decaf snelfilter maling (quick filter grind) for the 250ml coffee, Bolletje Kruidnoten (small spiced bisquits), generic Albert Heijn hot coco mix, generic sugar, generic salt, generic eggs.
